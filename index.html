    <p>I am an IT student at AkiraChix,aspiring to be a front-end web developer with a passion for implementing the visual elements into interfaces that users can interact with.I have always had a knack for linking the word of design and technology.My favourite quote is If you love your work, youâ€™ll be out there every day trying to do it the best you possibly can, and pretty soon everybody around will catch the passion from you like a fever.</p>
    <p>I remember my love for reading began at a very young age.I would read alot of novels  and by the time I was in my early teens,I could handle novels with lots of pages.Writing is also one of the things that I might consider in future if things go so well in the articles below.</p>
    <p>I also enjoy sports.I remember watching it with my older brother especially seeing his favourite team which is Arsenal winning trophies after trophies .I loved football so much that I even decided to play it in primary school and also in high school and this left some of the most memorable moments in my life.I also enjoy basketball and I hope that one day I will get an opportunity to shoot some hoops or dunk some balls.</p>
    <p>As you indulge in this article ,may you enjoy it and always find that which you are looking for!</p>

            <p>Majority of people are normally tied to their current situation and the belief that they cannot achieve or excel beyond what they vision.Growing up I remember all the dreams that I had as a kid to be a Doctor,Engineer,Lawyer or Architect.The key thing that kept ringing in my mind is the amount of fee that was to be paid if I was to pursue such careers and I suddenly lost interest  but I ended up in a different field a rather interesting one.My friend who wanted to become an air hostess so bad decided to give up because of body weight issues something she would have worked on if she really was determined.</p>
			<p>The first step in visualizing beyond our experience and current situation is to discover what we really want.A predator will stop at nothing until it gets its prey.This step brings motivation and zeal to work for what we want.When we identify what we really want we will always find opportunity that will lead you to accomplish the goal.I am always marvelled at how when you promise a kid a gift in return for good grade,he/she will work hard and deliver with this same same kind of determination we should be inspired to set our goals and work on them.</p>
			<p>The second step is to remove any doubt that we may have towards achieving what we have set.Most unfulfilled goals are due to lack of confidence and self doubt.Most people let the situation they are going through or have gone through in the past dictate their life,for some lack of finances is a huge barrier towards achieving what they want.People should realize that doors open naturally for go-getters no matter their situation.Confiidence is another important tool that cannot be bought but rather caltivated.Hanging out with the right crew and standing up for what someone believes in is another way of building confidence.</p>
			<p>The third step is having a mentor or a role model.Most succcesful people have gain motivation by people they look upto.I am always reminded of the famous words if you hangout with a millionaire and you shall become one.Like-minded people tend to support each other and pull each other to their level.Every story is an inspiration and a voice of hope to those who want to make a change in their lives and in the society</p>
			<p>The last step is to document all our achievement no matter how little they are.Progress is progress regardless of the quantity.Doing this boosts our pride and confidence level and also moitivates us to do more.If you reward someone for job well done,the person will always strive to their best.Little achievements always amount to bigger ones in future</p>
			<p>In conclusion for us to visualize beyond what we see and experience,we should believe in ourselves,let not what we are going through define us and be ready to work so as to achieve what we have set our minds on</p>

            <p>Our forefathers fought for independence in hopes of redeeming our land and restoring our culture,despite all this the aftermath of the colonial period is still here with us.We have also gone to an extent of developing western cultures that are poison to our used-to-be well natured society.Generations after generations embrace the culture and practise it to their maximum</p>
			<p>Some of the progressive colonial actions are oppression of the poor.Some rich employers have been reported to the court of law for oppression and exploitation of their employees,but the cases disappear as soon as they are presented in court.Others have gone to an extent of exposing their employees to harsh working conditions.A man once collapsed and died in a mining site due to a weak ladder falling apart and that was the end of his story,very sad.Some local industries also dispose waste material that harm the lives of poor innocent people who cannot fight for their right.</p>
			<p>Land grabbing has also been a major issue especially to people who cannot defend themselves.We have had cases of people being killed because they refused to surrender their property.People with many hectares of land have been questioned in the court of law of the ownership of their properties but the justice system is so corrupt that after a lump some of money the case is dismissed leaving more people miserable. </p>
			<p>The role of women in the society is another issue,women are expected to be nothing but child bearers and home makers.If you ask a succesful woman how she got to achieve what she has now,she will tell you of how she had to work twice as hard as the man in the same path.They are also judgement that comes with being a succesful woman.They are normally called disrespectful and hard headed in some of our communities.Widows are also denied the right to inherit their deceased spouses properties just because they are women.The number of women in our parliament is low as compared to the number of men  thus if the bills discussed are in regards to gender equality,the chances of such bills being passed amount to zero </p>
			<p>Some assimilated cultures are not that progressive for example dressing code.Yes we used to have so many people coping the westeners style of dressing but still we are able to witness people adorning themselves in traditional clothing especially when attending cultural events.We have also witnessed Ankara as a common piece of dressing especially to couples and families.Some cultures like the Maasai and the turkana people have been maintaining their cultural way of dressing.</p>
			<p>Change is inevitable but culture is something that was there during our forefathers days and we should treasure every aspect of it.Events like cultural days can be organized and different cultures can interact and share what the communities seem to have forgotten.On the poor being exploited and oppressed,the government and the labour society should step in and ensure that the workers are taken care of.The justice system should also step in and deliver justice to all those who seek it.To the women who fight in day in day out for equality kudos,more women should be motivated to join this fulfilling battle</p>
			<p>In conclusion,we are all human,beneath the skin we are all equal and the same.We should embrace one another and work together,other external cultures should not separate us. </p>

  	<h4>CREATIVITY</h4>
    <img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/102127/pexels-photo-102127.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&dpr=1&w=500" width="600px" style="width:100%">
            <p>Covid 19 has robbed us of so many key activities,one being the right to enjoy education.Many schools closed with an anticipation of resuming after three months but it has been six months since schools were closed and the hope to resuming school this year is long forgotten.Students are now at home roaming around with a small population affording to engage in online studies.With the amount of peer pressure that is out there ,they all need some tips to be able to 'survive' during this period so that they can join school again in January.One,they should understand their purpose and what drives them or motivates them as a student.People go to school for different reasons but I believe that there is that one common goal among a higher percentage of students and that is to create a strong and better foundation for themselves,so if they set their goals and targets right there is nothing that can stop them in achieving what they want.</p>
			<p>Peer pressure is an enemy of progress,people always want to fit in and some will go to an extent of completely changing their character and behaviour so as to be "cool" .In the generation that we are in,we have cleary witnessed the aftermath of hanging out with the wrong crowd.Bullets,unwanted pregnancy,diseases are just some of the consequences but one major unmentioned issue is the mental torture that one goes through after taking a wrong turn.Students should keep the right company,they associate with the people who want to build them and by doing this we are assurred that a good future lies ahead. </p>
			<p>During this time although physical interaction has become really hard,its time to be creative and explore technology to the fullest.Student can create online communities whereby they can form study groups in which can revise their course work and also challenge one another and explore more.They can also be a huge help in managing of covid 19 by forming groups that will aim at creating awareness and also aid in distributing food and other neccessities to the less fortunate people in the community. </p>
			<p>Talent is a gift  that can change somebody's life ,students can engage in artwork,beadwork,pottery and knitting.I know of a form three student who earns around three thousand a week from knitting.They can also do graffiti and potraits to help create awareness of covid 19 all around the community.</p>
			<p>One of the most underatted activity is exercising,I remember back in high school how we used to complain everytime during PE lessons because we did not want to exercise instead we wanted to take a forty minutes power nap.I did not see the importance of the forced exercising routine until some years later when we went hiking and let's say one of our group member had to be carried all the way home.Practising a healthy exercise routine is very important,it keeps the mind fresh and the body very productive.For good results and brain development student should aim to atleast do one exercise per day.</p>
			<p>The community should also aim at supporting the students.Over the past months the number of pregnancy has risen to a shocking number,majority of th victims are raped in silence and the community has done nothing concrete about it.I remember as a kid we were usually warned about a certain man who use to rape young girls and we would see him approaching our direction and immmediately run for our life.I never understood why they could not report him to the police romours had it that he was in and out if jail for that same reason countless times.In my opinion he should have stayed in forever.This is one of the cases that the community tolerates,some individual fear reporting the person citing that some have connection in the justice depaertment who can bail them out.What a world! but thanks to the activits and organization that are here to fight for human rights.No one should suffer in silence and also the community should aim to support one another especially the upcoming generation because they are the future and caretakers of tomorrow. </p>
			<p>In conclusion,an investment in knowledge pays the best interest,education is the passport to the future,for tomorrow belongs to those who prepare for it today.In order to experience a better future,one must aim to create a good foundation for it.</p>
